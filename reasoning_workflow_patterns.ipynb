      "You can’t determine a single definitive “root cause” from just those three timestamps. The sequence only tells you **the failure mode**, not *why* it started.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What the timeline *does* suggest\n",
      "- **10:00 Memory jumps to 95%**: the process or OS is under memory pressure (could be a leak, a sudden workload spike, caching growth, large queries/results, GC pressure, etc.).\n",
      "- **10:02 DB connection pool exhausted**: the app is trying to get DB connections faster than it’s returning them. Common reasons:\n",
      "  - DB is slow/unavailable, so requests hold connections longer\n",
      "  - connection leak (connections not closed/returned)\n",
      "  - thread pool backlog causes requests to stall while holding connections\n",
      "- **10:03 Server unresponsive**: consistent with severe GC thrashing, swapping, thread starvation, or a cascading backlog where everything waits on resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Most plausible explanation (without more data)\n",
      "This looks like a **cascading resource exhaustion** event:\n",
      "1) something caused memory pressure and/or request backlog,  \n",
      "2) which increased request latency,  \n",
      "3) which caused DB connections to be held longer (or leaked),  \n",
      "4) which exhausted the pool and made the server appear hung.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Is it a memory leak?\n",
      "Possible, but not provable. A **memory leak typically shows a steady upward trend** over time; “spiked to 95%” could also be a traffic spike, a batch job, caching behavior, or large allocations. With only one data point, you can’t label it a leak.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Is it a database issue?\n",
      "Also possible. If the DB became slow/down first, the app could pile up waiting requests, retain more in-memory state, and then memory rises—*but your timeline shows memory spiking before the pool exhaustion*, which fits either:\n",
      "- app-side backlog/allocations first, then pool exhaustion, **or**\n",
      "- DB degradation starting slightly earlier than 10:00 but only reflected in memory at 10:00.\n",
      "\n",
      "### “Something else” that fits very well\n",
      "A **traffic spike / thundering herd / runaway job** can cause both:\n",
      "- higher memory usage (more concurrent requests, queues, buffers),\n",
      "- pool exhaustion (more concurrent DB usage),\n",
      "- eventual unresponsiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bottom line\n",
      "From these logs alone, the best conclusion is: **the crash was caused by a cascading overload where memory pressure and DB connection exhaustion reinforced each other.**  \n",
